## Project Introduction

PBL (Project Based Learning) Team is the final project of Data Analytics for Business bootcamp at Bitlabs Academy that is done in a team. In this project, we help a company that wants to develop its business by adjusting the intended target market by knowing the patterns in data transactions that are commonly captured from year to year.
